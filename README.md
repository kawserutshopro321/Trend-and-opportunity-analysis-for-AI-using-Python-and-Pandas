## 📌 Overview
 
This project analyses public discussion data from the **AI Stack Exchange** and **Data Science Stack Exchange** communities to identify longitudinal trends in topic popularity, community engagement, and thematic convergence across two of the world's largest AI practitioner communities.
 
The analysis was conducted as part of **SIT731 Data Analytics** at **Deakin University** and covers the period from **2014 to 2024** — spanning the rise of deep learning, the transformer era, and the generative AI wave triggered by ChatGPT.
 
The findings are translated into **actionable investment recommendations** for technology companies seeking to allocate AI research and product investment strategically.

## 🎯 Research Questions
 
- How has the volume of AI-related discussions changed over time?
- Which AI topics are becoming more or less popular among practitioners?
- How do engagement metrics vary across different AI sub-fields?
- What latent thematic structure exists in practitioner discourse?
- Are there measurable knowledge gaps that represent commercial opportunities?
- How does AI Stack Exchange differ strategically from Data Science Stack Exchange?

### 4. Configure Paths
 
Open the notebook and update the data directory paths:
 
```python
AI_PATH = 'data/ai/'   # Path to AI SE CSV files
DS_PATH = 'data/ds/'   # Path to DS SE CSV files
```
 
### 5. Run the Notebook
 
```bash
jupyter notebook 225586507_SIT731_AI_StackExchange_Analysis.ipynb

## 🔍 Key Findings
 
### 1. 🚀 ChatGPT Was a Structural Inflection Point
Monthly question volume on AI SE jumped sharply in November 2022 and has not reverted. This is a permanent structural shift in community focus, not a temporary spike.
 
### 2. 🤖 Generative AI Dominates Growth
Tags including `large-language-models`, `transformer`, `gpt`, and `prompt-engineering` show the steepest year-on-year growth rates of any topics from 2020–2023 — far outpacing all other AI sub-fields.
 
### 3. 🎯 Reinforcement Learning Is AI SE's Defining Topic
TF-IDF distinctiveness analysis reveals that `reinforcement-learning` is the single most discriminative term separating AI Stack Exchange from Data Science Stack Exchange — even more distinctive than LLM-related terms.
 
### 4. ⏱️ Knowledge Gaps = Commercial Opportunities
Emerging LLM-adjacent tags show high view counts and high scores but **low acceptance rates and long response times** — a clear signal that practitioner demand structurally outpaces expert supply in these areas.
 
### 5. 📐 Extreme Knowledge Concentration
The top 1% of contributors account for over 50% of answers on both platforms (Gini > 0.85). AI SE shows higher inequality than DS SE, making it more vulnerable to quality degradation as expert attention migrates to new topics.
 
### 6. 📉 Data Science SE Is Plateauing
DS SE question volume peaked in 2019 and has declined since, while AI SE continues to grow. This divergence signals that applied data science has entered a consolidation phase while AI research remains expansionary.
 
### 7. 🔮 LLM Topics Forecast to Dominate Through 2026
Linear regression trend forecasting projects that `large-language-models`, `prompt-engineering`, and `transformer` will maintain the steepest positive growth slopes through 2026.
